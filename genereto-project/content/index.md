## You found **Federico Ponzi**'s home page!

I'm a computer scientist and a software engineer interested in the intersection of Distributed Systems and Operating Systems.

I currently work as a **Software Development Engineer** at [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/ "AWS CloudFront") on the [Regional Edge Caches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowCloudFrontWorks.html#CloudFrontRegionaledgecaches).

These days, my favorite programming languages are Rust, Java, Python. As I try to use the best tool for the job, I also know other programming and scripting languages as well.

I hold a master degree in Computer Science. During my studies, I've also published a [paper](https://fponzi.me/pubs/biopen.pdf "Biopenâ€“Fusing password choice and biometric interaction at presentation level") on biometric systems.

Lately, I like to spend my free time reading papers/books, programming side projects in Rust, physical exercising or hiking.
